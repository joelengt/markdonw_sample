## Workshop notes

### These pillars represent your brand's personality

They should come through in every interaction with your customers.

### Memorize them

Put these brand pillars in a prominent location (around the office, online etc) so that your team is exposed to them every day.

### Refer to them when you're making a hard decision

These brand pillars should guide your decision making for all of your initiative (product, marketing, communications etc).

When you're making a decision, ask yourself which option aligns most with your brand values.

### Grade yourself over time

- Check in regularly with your team to make sure you're living up to your values.
- Ask your customers if they feel you're living up to them as well.

Thoughtful

### Unity

Success is a result of building strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our colleagues, partners and customers all over the world.
